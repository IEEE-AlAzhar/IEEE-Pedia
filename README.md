# IEEE Pedia

This is the encyclopedia of `IEEE Al-Azhar` where you can contribute or read new information about any technical field `e.g web, mobile, AI, problem solving, ...etc`. Any one can contribute to this project and collaborate with our technical staff to generate valuable and modern information. These articles may be added to our [official website](https://www.ieee-azhar.com/).

## Structure
<a name="structure"></a>

The structure of our encyclopedia is simple, forward and easy to get involved rapidly. There's two folders in our pedia: `articles/` & `resources/`.

The `articles/` contains categories and inside each category lives the articles categorized by this category. For example, the `web/` folder contains `.md` files about the web field like `HTML, Javascript, ...etc`, also the category folder may contains a subcategory folder, for example, the `software/` folder may contains another folder for subcategory like `software-design, clean-code, ...etc`.

The `resources/` folder contains external resources about the categories inside the `articles/` folder, for example, the `mobile.md` file contains all the external resources about mobile field and the single file is divided into sections to be organized. In the future, there may be a sub-resource folder to store all the external resources into its own file not on a section in a single file.
