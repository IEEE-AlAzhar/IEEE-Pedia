# For Absolute Beginners (Arabic) 
  <a name = "a"></a>
I would recommend for **Arabic** speaker absolute beginners to start with this channel (PHP Anonymous), 
since it is very simple and will build some strong base before heading to any English speaking course.

1. [Dart Introductioin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wotl0y87X-Q&list=PL3aG1K3LWCrdihgr1PnIrbphTyt3PZwoK)
  - This introduction for dart will help you engage in later English courses.
2. [Flutter Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA93-dOjSwY&list=PL3aG1K3LWCrfxDL6g1dqOXSNjwtA7zhm6)
  - This introduction is somehow useful for absolute beginners as it provides 
     the basic knowledge to deal with the most common widgets in the Flutter Framework.
     
# For Beginners   
<a name = "b"></a>
For those who don't have a problem watching a complete  English course I would recommend two popular courses that you can find on Udemey:

1. [The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)
   - This course is highly recommended for any one who prefers simplicity. 
     Also, Dr Angela Yu, the instructor, is known for her wonderful explanation for the complicated parts.
2. [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2020 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)     
   - In this course Max explains more advanced topics than Angela does in her mentioned course above.
3. [Code2Start](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvrQznWIljgoa0y1sY4JDPg/playlists)
   - This channel on Youtube is just awesome, and it is a good free option. Also, it is well organized that all playlists are 
      numbered, so you can watch them in order, and also, every playlist is found in both **Arabic** and **English**.
   
   **Those courses are the most popular ones, but you may search and find a course that can be more suitable for your needs and level.**
