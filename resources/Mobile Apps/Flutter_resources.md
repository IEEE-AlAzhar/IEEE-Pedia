# Welcome to IEEE-AlAzhar univesity student branch open-source IEEE-Pedia
This file is dedicated to provide a wide range of different resources 
to help you have a better experience learning **Flutter**.

# For Absolute Beginners (Arabic) 
I would recommend for Arabic speaker absolute beginners to start with this channel (PHP Anonymous), 
since it is very simple and will build some strong base before heading to any English speaking course.

1. [Dart Introductioin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-rv6vQfXq8&list=PLcfD4HARQRF-vr7yI0KkQAs2HzqyG7k2j)
  - This introduction for dart will you engage in later English courses.
2. [Flutter Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kggAr5GhPFw&list=PLcfD4HARQRF9ToPIW_kdQjBg6ARV2BXYL)
  - This introduction is somehow useful for absolute beginners as it provides 
     the basic knowledge to deal with the most common widgets in the Flutter Framework.
     
# For Beginners    
For those who don't have a problem watching a complete  English course I would recommend two popular courses that you can find on Udemey:

1. [The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)
   - This course is highly recommended for any one who prefers simplicity. 
     Also, Dr Angela Yu, the instructor, is known for her wonderful explanation for the complicated parts.
2. [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2020 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)     
   - In this course Max explains more advanced topics than Angela does in her mention course above.
   
   **Those two courses are the most popular ones, but you may search and find a course that can be more suitable for your needs and level.**
