# Welcome to IEEE-AlAzhar univesity student branch open-source IEEE-Pedia
This file is dedicated to provide a wide range of different resources 
to help you have a better experience learning **Flutter**.

# For Absolute Beginners (Arabic) 
I would recommend for **Arabic** speaker absolute beginners to start with this channel (PHP Anonymous), 
since it is very simple and will build some strong base before heading to any English speaking course.

1. [Dart Introductioin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-rv6vQfXq8&list=PLcfD4HARQRF-vr7yI0KkQAs2HzqyG7k2j)
  - This introduction for dart will you engage in later English courses.
2. [Flutter Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kggAr5GhPFw&list=PLcfD4HARQRF9ToPIW_kdQjBg6ARV2BXYL)
  - This introduction is somehow useful for absolute beginners as it provides 
     the basic knowledge to deal with the most common widgets in the Flutter Framework.
     
# For Beginners    
For those who don't have a problem watching a complete  English course I would recommend two popular courses that you can find on Udemey:

1. [The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/)
   - This course is highly recommended for any one who prefers simplicity. 
     Also, Dr Angela Yu, the instructor, is known for her wonderful explanation for the complicated parts.
2. [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2020 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)     
   - In this course Max explains more advanced topics than Angela does in her mention course above.
   
   **Those two courses are the most popular ones, but you may search and find a course that can be more suitable for your needs and level.**
